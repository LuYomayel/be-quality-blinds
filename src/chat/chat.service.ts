COMPLETE PRODUCT CATALOG:

• ROLLER BLINDS: Offer a modern look and efficient light control. They use minimal space, ideal for tight areas like kitchens or bathrooms. Available in:
  - BLOCKOUT ROLLER BLINDS: Made of thick coated fabric that blocks 100% of light. Great for bedrooms, offices, and anywhere you need full darkness. They help regulate room temperature by keeping heat out in summer and warmth in during winter, potentially lowering energy bills. Designed to withstand harsh Australian sun without compromising style or durability.
  - SUNSCREEN ROLLER BLINDS: Mesh-like blinds that filter glare and UV rays, protecting furniture and keeping your space cooler. Provide daytime privacy but become see-through at night when lights are on, so often paired with a blockout blind (e.g. in a Double Roller setup) for full privacy. Come in a wide range of sunscreen fabrics and colors to suit any décor.
  - TRANSLUCENT ROLLER BLINDS: Also called Light Filtering or Privacy Blinds, they allow natural light in while obscuring the view from outside. Perfect for living areas or bathrooms where you want 100% daytime privacy without losing daylight. They create an opaque glow (not see-through) that reduces heat and glare but still brightens the room. (Note: At night, they do not provide full privacy if lights are on inside.)
  - DOUBLE ROLLER: Combines blockout + sunscreen in same bracket for ultimate flexibility

• ROMAN BLINDS: Fabric blinds that fold into pleats when raised, adding a soft touch. They use beautiful linens or cottons for a subtle, cozy charm. Often used to create a layered look (they pair well with sheer curtains or roller blinds) and provide a warmer decor effect. Available in:
  - BLOCKOUT ROMAN BLINDS: Use opaque blockout fabrics to darken a room. Custom-made with quality fabrics and supplied on a chain-operated track with back battens for a smooth look. Can have an additional blackout lining added, making them great for bedrooms or media rooms. Easy to install and require less maintenance than venetian blinds; they can be motorised (either initially or upgraded later) for convenience.
  - TRANSLUCENT ROMAN BLINDS: Use light-filtering translucent fabrics that let in filtered light while providing privacy. Ideal for living areas – when closed they block the view from outside but still glow with daylight. The amount of light depends on fabric weight/weave. (Unlike sunscreen rollers, translucent Romans do block the view when closed.)
  Roman Blinds are generally easy to use; small to medium sizes can be cord-drawn, while larger blinds often come with a chain control for smoother operation.

• VENETIAN BLINDS: Classic horizontal slat blinds available in timber and metal options. They offer excellent light and privacy control by tilting the slats at any angle. Venetians are space-efficient and durable – especially suited for wet areas if choosing the right material. Quality Blinds manufactures these in Australia, often able to fabricate and install within ~7 days of quote approval. Types include:
  - ALUMINIUM VENETIAN BLINDS: Made from specialized aluminium alloy slats. Best for kitchens, bathrooms or any splash-prone area since they won't warp with moisture and can be easily wiped clean. Available in 25mm or 50mm slat widths and a huge range of finishes (metallic, woodgrain effect, satin, gloss, matte, perforated, etc.) and colors from pastels to vibrant metallics. Quality Blinds uses thicker-than-standard slats for extra durability. These are highly practical and give a modern, minimalist look.
  - BASSWOOD VENETIAN BLINDS: Crafted from natural basswood timber, which is lightweight for easy operation but also strong. Basswood brings a warm, natural aesthetic and comes in a variety of stains and tints to match your furniture or trim. They are easy to maintain and clean, and very durable. (Basswood is a popular choice for those wanting real wood blinds with a uniform grain.)
  - CEDAR VENETIAN BLINDS: Made from genuine red cedar wood, giving rich color and character. Cedar adds warmth and is very dimensionally stable – it doesn't easily warp or swell with humidity or temperature changes. This stability and light weight make cedar blinds long-lasting. They come with quality cords and tilt mechanisms for smooth operation. Cedar Venetians create a premium look; they're often recommended for living rooms, bedrooms, and offices (not ideal for constantly damp areas). Installation is straightforward, and these wooden blinds are relatively easy to fit over windows.

• CURTAINS: Quality Blinds offers custom Curtains in a wide array of fabrics and styles, providing both elegance and functionality. Two main types are:
  - BLOCKOUT CURTAINS: Heavy drapery with a special backing or triple weave that blocks ~99% of light and UV rays. Ideal for bedrooms, home theatres, or anywhere you need darkness. They also have excellent thermal insulation – reducing heat transfer through windows by up to ~24%, helping rooms stay cooler in summer and warmer in winter. This can improve energy efficiency of the home. Quality Blinds' blockout curtains use a proprietary 3-layer fabric that provides these insulating benefits and protects against UV fading. They come in various designs and colors to match your decor. (Benefits: privacy, light control, noise dampening, and energy savings).
  - SHEER CURTAINS: Light, translucent curtains that diffuse sunlight and add an airy, soft look. Often made of voile or similar fabrics, sheers allow natural light to filter through while providing daytime privacy. They are perfect for living rooms or any space where you want gentle light and a breezy feel. Sheers are commonly layered with blockout curtains or blinds (you can have sheers for the day and heavier curtains or blinds for night). Note: Sheer curtains provide only limited privacy at night – once interior lights are on, they become almost transparent. So for bedrooms or at night, they are usually paired with blockouts or used in less private areas. Quality Blinds offers sheer curtains in many designs, from modern eyelet sheers to classic pleated styles, in colors to complement any palette.
  - VERI SHADES: Combine the softness of curtains with the versatility of blinds. Veri Shades have alternating opaque and sheer fabric panels that can be adjusted for more light or more privacy – essentially giving you the effect of vertical blinds and curtains in one product. These are great for living areas where you want flexibility between an open sheer look and closed privacy.

• SHUTTERS: Custom Plantation Shutters and other interior shutters are a signature product. Shutters are hinged panels with adjustable louvres, offering a timeless look and excellent control over light, airflow, and privacy. Quality Blinds manufactures shutters in various materials to suit different needs and budgets. All are made with quality craftsmanship for durability. Key shutter types:
  - MDF SHUTTERS (WOODLORE PLUS): Made from an Engineered Wood Composite (EWC) core with a tough polypropylene coating, giving the appearance of painted wood but with added durability and moisture resistance. This is the world's best-selling shutter program due to its quality and value. Woodlore Plus shutters feature lightweight yet robust ABS louvres (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, a high-grade recyclable plastic) combined with a strong engineered wood frame. This hybrid design allows wider panels (up to 20% wider than standard) without warping. Benefits: Very affordable (the most cost-effective shutter line), a fine smooth finish, and available in 9 contemporary white and neutral colors. They are VOC-safe (low off-gassing) and CARB P2 compliant, meaning no harmful formaldehyde emissions. Louvres come in 5 sizes (47mm up to 114mm) to match your style. Woodlore Plus shutters also offer an invisible tilt option (no visible tilt rod – the louvres move in unison via hidden mechanism) for a clean look.
  - ABS SHUTTERS (WOODLORE PLUS ABS): These shutters have components made entirely or primarily of ABS plastic, making them extremely durable and lightweight. They inherit many features of the Woodlore Plus line. ABS shutters can span wider panels (up to 920mm) with less weight than PVC, due to the material's strength. They are also environment-friendly and family-safe – materials are recyclable and free of harmful additives. Like other Quality Blinds shutters, they include the invisible tilt mechanism standard (no extra charge) for easy light control without a rod. ABS shutters come in 23 standard colors (with custom colors available) and even offer a Waterproof option for wet areas.
  - ABS WATERPROOF SHUTTERS: A fully waterproof variant, ideal for bathrooms, kitchens, laundries or any high-humidity area. They are made 100% from hard-wearing ABS, including panels and frames, and use stainless steel hardware so nothing will rust. Despite being plastic, they look just like painted wood shutters and share all the same features (invisible tilt, same color range of 23 whites/neutrals). These are perfect for households where knocks and bumps happen – they're very tough and family-friendly. Available in the 5 louvre size options as well.
  - BASSWOOD SHUTTERS: Made from premium basswood timber, but with an EWC (engineered wood) frame to blend affordability and strength. Basswood shutters are lighter weight than some hardwoods, allowing panel widths up to ~1066mm and more configuration options. They come in 27 paint colors (and also stain finishes) including custom color matching. Five louvre sizes are offered (same standard range). Basswood provides a classic wooden shutter look with a smooth, uniform grain. These shutters can even be used as door panels or crafted into special shapes for unique windows.
  - PHOENIXWOOD SHUTTERS: Crafted from 100% Phoenixwood, which is a premium lightweight hardwood known for its beautiful grain and durability. Phoenixwood shutters are considered a luxury option – they have rich natural wood character and can be finished in 51 colors (paint and wood stains) or custom colors. Each Phoenixwood shutter is hand-sanded and finished multiple times for a furniture-quality appearance. They allow wider single panels (up to ~1095mm) for more open views. Like others, they include the invisible tilt option and come in 5 louvre sizes. This wood is sourced from sustainable plantations, so it's an eco-friendly choice. Phoenixwood's strength-to-weight ratio and natural insulating properties make it both elegant and functional.
  - PVC PLANTATION SHUTTERS: Made from rigid PVC (often with an aluminum core for reinforcement). PVC shutters are moisture-proof and extremely stable, so they won't warp, crack or rot – great for humid climates or wet areas. They are also low-maintenance; they can be wiped clean easily. Quality Blinds' PVC shutters are available in various styles and typically in white or neutral tones. They provide good insulation as well – helping keep heat out in summer and in during winter, similar to other shutters (this contributes to energy savings). PVC shutters tend to be more affordable than hardwood, making them a popular budget-conscious choice. Because of their water resistance, PVC shutters are commonly used in bathrooms, kitchens, or anywhere you want the look of plantation shutters but need extra durability.

• AWNINGS: Quality Blinds offers a range of outdoor awnings to provide shade and weather protection for windows and outdoor living areas. All awnings use durable materials (like acrylic canvas fabrics and corrosion-resistant components) to withstand the elements. Major awning styles include:
  - FOLDING ARM AWNINGS: Retractable awnings with arms that fold in and out, ideal for patios, decks, or shopfronts. They provide excellent shade coverage for large areas – even up to about 7 meters wide – without any posts or beams (the awning supports itself with folding arms). When retracted (closed), the awning folds neatly against the wall, giving you full control of when you want shade or sun. Quality Blinds offers two styles: Semi-Cassette (the awning fabric is partially enclosed when rolled up, often mounted under eaves for added protection), and Full Cassette (the fabric and mechanism are completely enclosed in a protective box when retracted). The full-cassette style is ideal for larger areas like big patios or poolsides, as it maximizes fabric life by sheltering it from weather when not in use. Operation: Folding arm awnings can be crank-operated manually or motorised. Motorisation is popular – they can include sun and wind sensors to automatically extend or retract them for comfort or safety. They can also integrate with home automation or remote controls. The arms use high-tension springs and durable stainless cables, and the frames are powder-coated (color-matched, e.g. Dulux Duralloy colors) for longevity. Folding arm awnings are a great option if you want on-demand shade over large outdoor areas without permanent structure.
  - STRAIGHT DROP AWNINGS (DROP CURTAINS): These awnings drop down vertically to cover windows or enclose outdoor spaces. They are commonly used on the exterior of windows, pergolas, or balconies to provide shade and UV protection without cluttering the interior view. Quality Blinds offers straight drop awnings in various fabrics: attractive acrylic or canvas fabrics for solid shade, mesh sunscreen fabrics that block UV but maintain some view, or even clear PVC for weather protection that still lets you see through. They allow you to create an outdoor room or keep sun off windows. Typically operated by a simple crank handle (very easy to use with minimal effort). These too can be motorised and tied into sensors – for instance, a wind sensor can retract them automatically to avoid wind damage. Straight drop awnings are a flexible solution for decks and patios: you can roll them down when the sun is low or the wind is blowing, and retract them when not needed.
  - CONSERVATORY AWNINGS: A specialized motorized awning designed to cover glass roofs or sunroom ceilings (also used on skylights or pergolas). The Conservatory Awning system is fully automated – typically motor-driven and operated by remote control. At the press of a button, you can extend it to cover a glass conservatory roof and block heat/sun, and retract it when you want sky views. When retracted, it tucks into a discrete headbox casing, protecting it from weather and prolonging its life. This is an ideal solution for sunroom interiors or outdoor glass-covered areas where heat becomes an issue – it stops the greenhouse effect by shading from the outside.
  - TRADITIONAL AWNINGS: Classic style awnings that have been made by Quality Blinds for many years. These might include fixed fabric window awnings or auto-arm awnings (the kind that have arms that slide on rails). The company notes that they have continuously improved their traditional awning designs to handle local weather conditions. For example, they upgraded some of the timber boxing to more durable aluminum casings on the top and back, to resist weathering. Traditional awnings often are the ones you see above windows on older homes or shops, providing shade and reducing direct sun inside. Quality Blinds uses high quality fabrics and components so these awnings can withstand sun, wind, and weather. In summary, expect a long-lasting, time-tested product that blends with classic architecture.

• OTHER SHADE PRODUCTS: Quality Blinds also supplies various outdoor and specialty products:
  - EXTERNAL VENETIAN BLINDS: These are like Venetian blinds but made for exterior use (often mounted outside windows on modern homes or offices). They significantly reduce heat entering the building while still allowing adjustable light control. The slats can be tilted to reflect sun or provide privacy, then raised completely if needed. Benefits: They keep the interior cooler in summer and can block cold drafts in winter, improving energy efficiency. The innovative external Venetian system gives unmatched control over light and heat – allowing natural daylight in without the full brunt of direct sun, thus avoiding glare and the "hothouse" effect. They are suitable for both residential and commercial buildings, often seen on large windows or facade systems.
  - SHADE SAILS: Tensioned membrane sails for outdoor shade. Shade sails are made from durable, UV-blocking fabric and are stretched between anchor points (like posts or building attachments) to cast shade over patios, driveways, pools, etc. They are extremely effective at blocking the sun's harmful UV rays – protecting people and even property (like cars) from sun damage. With shade sails, you can enjoy outdoor areas more comfortably by lowering temperatures under the sail and avoiding sunburn. Quality Blinds offers weather-resistant shade sails in various shapes and colors. (These are custom measured and installed to fit your space.)
  - ROLLER SHUTTERS: Secure, roll-up metal shutters typically mounted on the exterior of windows or doors. Roller shutters provide security, storm protection, and light block-out. They are described as "practical, durable, and secure," offering added protection against harsh weather, noise and would-be intruders. When closed, they can fully darken a room and significantly reduce noise (useful for bedrooms or street-facing windows). Quality Blinds' roller shutters are custom-fitted and can be manually operated or motorized. They're a great option if security and insulation are priorities – common for ground floor windows, shop fronts or garages.
  - LOUVERS: Adjustable louvre systems or outdoor louvered roofs. These are aluminum louver panels that can be used as sunshades or privacy screens. Generally louvers allow ventilation and some light while blocking direct sun or visibility. They might offer fixed aluminum louver awnings or screens for exteriors.
  - OUTDOOR UMBRELLAS: Commercial-grade Cafe Series Umbrellas for patios and cafes. These are sturdy yet lightweight aluminum-frame umbrellas designed for heavy use. They come in three sizes (including approximately 2.1m square, 3.0m square, and 3.0m octagonal). The canopies are made of high-quality Spuncrylic canvas – a durable, UV-resistant outdoor fabric that is water-resistant (great for printing logos). Quality Blinds' umbrellas are popular for restaurants and cafes because they can be branded with a company logo on the canopy. Despite being commercial grade, they are easy to handle – most have an easy two-piece pole (except the largest) for transport/storage and feature an umbrella safety locking pin to prevent accidental collapse. Other features include: a wind vent and top cap for stability in breezes, high-quality pulley or rope systems, and multiple base options (bolt-down, in-ground socket, or mobile base) for installation. The aluminum mast (about 48mm diameter) keeps weight down while ensuring strength, and it's powder-coated (in black) for corrosion resistance. These umbrellas are built to last years in harsh sun and weather, making them suitable for home use as well for those wanting a premium outdoor umbrella.
  - POLYCARBONATE ROOFING: Polycarbonate panels or awnings that can be installed as patio roofs, awning covers, or pergola infills. Polycarbonate is a transparent, UV-stabilized plastic sheet used for letting light in while sheltering from rain and UV. Quality Blinds may offer polycarbonate roofing solutions for patios or carports – providing a covered area that still allows natural light. These panels are lightweight, durable, and resist yellowing.
